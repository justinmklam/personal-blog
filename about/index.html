Maneuvering starfighters through the Hoth asteroid field whilst in aerial combat, jousting battle droids wielding nothing but a lightsaber, and having my hand sliced off to make space for my own mechno-arm were the epitomes of my childhood fantasy.</p><p>Reality came quite bluntly, yet these dreams continued to flourish. These days, they follow more along the lines of maneuvering through complex codebases, attacking architectural design challenges with a pen and paper, and putting my mechatronics background to good use by working on fun side projects.</p><p>My experience encompasses rapid prototyping, manufacturing, medical devices, automation, robotics, and control systems. As a continuously growing engineer, I am constantly looking for opportunities to expand and develop my skill set.</p><p style=text-align:right><i>Justin M.K.
