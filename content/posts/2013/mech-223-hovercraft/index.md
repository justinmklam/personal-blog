For our final MECH2 design project at UBC, we were given three weeks to research, conceptualize, test, and build a functional hovercraft. The end goal was a class-wide competition of speed, cargo capacity, maneuverability, and driving skill. Budget was limited since costs came out of our own pockets, so we set out to build an inexpensive hovercraft using parts from the hardware and dollar store.

Our result: 5th place out of 30 teams. Not too shabby for a hovercraft made with foam and garbage bags!
