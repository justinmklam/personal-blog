Our city had bylaws on having chickens, which included:</p><ul><li>A maximum of 4 hens (no roosters), 4 months or older</li><li>Ducks, turkeys, or other livestock are not allowed</li><li>Eggs, meat, and manure cannot be used for commercial purposes</li><li>Backyard slaughtering is not allowed</li></ul><p>Since we were fortunate enough to have access to a backyard at the time, we decided to build a coop and start the lifestyle of having easy access to fresh eggs. Was it cost effective? Heck no, but it sure was a fun journey!</p></p><div class="nav-btn readmore-btn"><a href=https://justinmklam.com/posts/2021/06/chicken-coop/>Read More ></a></div><hr><h2 class=blog-title><a href=https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/phone-stand/>Wooden Phone Stand</a></h2><p class=blog-title-metadata>Posted on November 13, 2016

I&rsquo;m a firm believer in having a dedicated place for everything as a solution to keep things tidy, so making a phone stand for my desk at work just made sense.</p><p>I started off on Google to look for existing designs I could imitate, but most fell short of not fitting my aesthetic needs. I wanted a balance between simplicity and form, without requiring too much effort to make. I eventually came across one design by <a href=https://www.artfire.com/ext/shop/product_view/woodenlife/12640827/creative_wood_phone_stand_handmade/handmade/woodworking/other>Woodenlife on Artfire</a> and deemed it the winner for my copy-cat woodworking. I sketched out the side profile in SolidWorks, pasted it on to the wood block, and proceeded to cut it out on my bandsaw.</p></p><div class="nav-btn readmore-btn"><a href=https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/phone-stand/>Read More ></a></div><hr><h2 class=blog-title><a href=https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/bandsaw/>Making Do With a Bargain Bin Bandsaw</a></h2><p class=blog-title-metadata>Posted on October 22, 2016

But what this really means is that I get a chance to claim space to set up an actual workshop! First project was naturally a workbench, which I put together using 2x4&rsquo;s and a 3/4" MDF board for the work surface (see above). Second project was a bench stool, as shown in the following images below. The builders left some 1/8" plywood in the yard, and I wanted to see how sturdy of a chair I can make with it given the inherent flimsiness of the thin sheet stock. By adding a reinforcing cross-brace at the base of the legs, I was able to significantly increase its sturdiness.</p></p><div class="nav-btn readmore-btn"><a href=https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/new-workshop/>Read More ></a></div><hr><h2 class=blog-title><a href=https://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/bamboo-bike-boo-boo/>Boo-Boo with the Bamboo Bike</a></h2><p class=blog-title-metadata>Posted on December 18, 2015

However, what you probably don&rsquo;t know is that I made some mistakes in the process. The photo above shows the result of one of these progress speedbumps, and yes, I did indeed cry the day I had to cut those tubes out.</p><p>I started this project in November 2013 but failed to finish due splitting bamboo. Progress was moving forward: I had the bamboo, carbon fibre, and epoxy ready for frame building, and the poles were in the process of being cut and shaped to size. However, winter was quickly approaching and the weather was becoming less and less ideal for carbon fibre layup. The epoxy I was using had a working temperature above 10Â°C, but the outside temperature was beginning to drop below that. I was able to keep it in its liquid state by using my mother&rsquo;s hair dryer (don&rsquo;t tell her though since she still doesn&rsquo;t know&mldr;), but the epoxy wasn&rsquo;t the main issue. Apparently bamboo is a living thing and doesn&rsquo;t like drastic changes in temperature. Turns out doing the layup in colder temperatures, then bringing the frame inside to dry in warm, livable temperatures wasn&rsquo;t good for the bamboo. Moisture is the devil here, and causes the wood to expand and contract based on the current environmental conditions.</p></p><div class="nav-btn readmore-btn"><a href=https://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/bamboo-bike-boo-boo/>Read More ></a></div><hr><h2 class=blog-title><a href=https://justinmklam.com/posts/2014/08/bamboo-bike/>Award Winning Bamboo Bike</a></h2><p class=blog-title-metadata>Posted on August 18, 2014
