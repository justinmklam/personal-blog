It was neat to monitor it this way, but it was fairly impractical to do for each feeding since it required setting up a camera, downloading the images, and doing some manual image cropping before running it through my analysis script. The analysis was also only done after the fact, and what I really wanted was something that could tell me when the starter was ready to be used (or fed), or, if I missed the window of opportunity, how long ago it peaked.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3D Printed Engagement Ring</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2019/diy-wedding-ring/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:50:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2019/diy-wedding-ring/</guid><description>&lt;p class="text-center" style="font-style:oblique">

&lt;p>For readers of my blog, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that I haven&amp;rsquo;t had any new content in the past year. For good reason though, as I got married in June! Aside from planning the proposal and wedding, I also had the lofty goal of designing and making my wife&amp;rsquo;s engagement ring.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this post, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my quest in designing and 3D printing the ring, along with some *&lt;em>minor&lt;/em>* mistakes I made.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Annealing 3D Printed Plastics: Sous Vide Style</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/06/sous-vide-pla/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:56:53 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/06/sous-vide-pla/</guid><description>&lt;p class="text-center" style="font-style:oblique">

&lt;p>Yep, you heard it right. With all the craze surrounding cooking sous vide these days, it was only a matter of time before someone decided to venture using it outside of the culinary world. Turns out that someone also had a 3D printer, and &lt;em>you won&amp;rsquo;t believe what happened next!&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Click-bait headlines aside, this post is quite lengthy and not everyone may have the patience to get through it all. Feel free to read the TL;DR below, or if you&amp;rsquo;re feeling inclined, follow along my adventure through the land of 3D printing, materials science, and modern cooking.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hakko-Style Solder Fume Extractor</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/03/solder-fume-extractor/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Mar 2017 21:14:29 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/03/solder-fume-extractor/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been slowly getting into the land of electrical pixies. So now, not only will I be inhaling sawdust, I can also fill them with leaded solder (because we all know that the performance of leaded solder takes higher priority than the safety of lead-free solder)! However, because I still value living, I figured I should get something to help get the solder fumes away from my lungs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At my current job with MistyWest, we have a nice, bench top solder fume extractor by Hakko. But I&amp;rsquo;m cheap, so heck no was I going to &lt;a href="https://www.digikey.ca/product-detail/en/american-hakko-products-inc/FA400-04/1691-1039-ND/6228795">pay over $100&lt;/a> for blowing away fumes when I can blow them away myself! Despite it being a nifty design with multiple configurations (shown in the images below), I would resist the temptation to lighten my wallet on this. Oh wait, I just bought a thing that I can use to make other things&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Resources for 3D Printing with the MP Select Mini</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/03/3d-printing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 19:38:27 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/03/3d-printing/</guid><description>&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s better than an inexpensive 3D printer?

&lt;p>Like any tech-enthusiast, I have toyed with the idea of owning a 3D printer for quite some time. For my final year mechatronics design project, my partner and I designed an extravagent contraption to measure the yolk done-ness of a soft-boiled egg, which we called &lt;a href="http://justinmklam.com/projects/mecha/perfeggct/">The PerfEGGct&lt;/a>. We borrowed my roommate&amp;rsquo;s 3D printer to create the enclosure, and it turned out to be an indispensable tool during our prototyping process. At the time, reliable 3D printers were upwards of $500 which was just out of my threshold for nice-to-have gadgets.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
