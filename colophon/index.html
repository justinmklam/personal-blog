In 2015, the inception of my personal blog was created on <a href=https://wordpress.com/>Wordpress</a> and hosted on <a href=https://www.bluehost.ca/>Bluehost</a>, and was intended to be a portfolio of my personal projects to showcase when applying to jobs. I spent a lot of time hunting for a suitable theme, and stuck with one for about a year.</p><p>In 2016, I wanted to start writing blog posts instead of just having a portfolio, and since I wanted more flexibility in how I was displaying content, I ventured into static site generators and settled on <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> and used <a href=https://getbootstrap.com/>Bootstrap</a> to create a custom theme. Later on, as I matured in my career, I realized that having a portfolio was no longer as relevant, so I combined the two types of content into a single blog-like website.</p><p>In 2019, I updated the styling to use more modern themeing. Then in 2021, I tried optimizing the git history to reduce the size when checking out, but made some critical errors (in not understanding what commands<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> I was executing from <a href=https://stackoverflow.com/questions>StackOverflow</a>) and had migrated to a new repo since, at the time, it was easier to start fresh than try and fix the mess that I made.</p><p>Returning from a break of creating content in 2025, I had a wave of motivation to update my website yet again. This current version is the third (and hopefully final) iteration, which does away with Bootstrap in favour of a more lightweight option. The siteâ€™s design uses plain HTML, CSS, and very minimal Javascript, and is based on a custom theme styled with <a href=https://github.com/codazoda/neatcss>Neat CSS</a>. The typeface leverages <code>system-ui</code> instead of custom typography from <a href=https://fonts.google.com/>Google Fonts</a> to ensure fast page rendering and avoid the dreaded <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_of_unstyled_content>FOUT</a>.</p><p>Content is written in <a href=https://github.com/yuin/goldmark>Goldmark-powered Markdown</a>. Code syntax highlighting is enabled by <a href=https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma>Chroma</a>. Mathematical formulas are rendered by <a href=https://www.mathjax.org/>Mathjax</a>. Icons are provided by <a href=https://fontawesome.com/>Font Awesome</a>.</p><p>Domain management and DNS are handled through <a href=https://www.namecheap.com/>Namecheap</a>. Hosting is managed by <a href=https://pages.github.com/>Github Pages</a>, where the site&rsquo;s content is stored in <a href=https://github.com/justinmklam/personal-blog>this repository</a> and deployed automatically via <a href=https://github.com/features/actions>Github Actions</a>.</p><p>This site uses <a href=https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/>Google Analytics</a> to help understand visitor traffic and usage patterns. Data collected is anonymous and used solely for improving the website experience.</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Pro tip: Don&rsquo;t run <code>git filter-repo --strip-blobs-bigger-than 1M</code> thinking that it won&rsquo;t also nuke all your currently used media files above that size.&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div><script defer type=text/javascript src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script><script defer id=dsq-count-scr src=//justinmklam.disqus.com/count.js async></script></body><footer><div class=footer-container><hr><p>&copy; 2025 Justin Lam | <a href=/colophon>Colophon</a></p></div></footer></html>
