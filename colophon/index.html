In 2015, the inception of my personal blog was created on <a href=https://wordpress.com/>Wordpress</a> and hosted on <a href=https://www.bluehost.ca/>Bluehost</a>, and was intended to be a portfolio of my personal projects to showcase when applying to jobs. I spent a lot of time hunting for a suitable theme, and stuck with one for about a year.</p><p>In 2016, I wanted to start writing blog posts instead of just having a portfolio, and since I wanted more flexibility in how I was displaying content, I ventured into static site generators and settled on <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> and used <a href=https://getbootstrap.com/>Bootstrap</a> to create a custom theme. Later on, as I matured in my career, I realized that having a portfolio was no longer as relevant, so I combined the two types of content into a single blog-like website.</p><p>In 2019, I updated the styling to use more modern themeing. Then in 2021, I tried optimizing the git history to reduce the size when checking out, but made some critical errors (in not understanding what commands I was executing from StackOverflow) and had migrated to a new repo since, at the time, it was easier to start fresh than try and fix the mess that I made.</p><p>Returning from a break of creating content in 2025, I had a wave of motivation to update my website yet again. This current version is the third (and hopefully final) iteration, which does away with Bootstrap in favour of a more lightweight option. The siteâ€™s design is based on a custom theme styled with <a href=https://github.com/codazoda/neatcss>Neat CSS</a>. The following fonts are used throughout this site and are hosted by <a href=https://fonts.google.com/>Google Fonts</a>: Fira Mono for code, Roboto Slab for headings, and Fira Sans for everything else.</p><p>Content is written in <a href=https://github.com/yuin/goldmark>Goldmark-flavoured Markdown</a>. Code syntax highlighting is provided by <a href=https://highlightjs.org/>highlight.js</a>. Mathematical formulas are rendered by <a href=https://www.mathjax.org/>Mathjax</a>. Icons are provided by <a href=https://fontawesome.com/>Font Awesome</a>.</p><p>Domain management and DNS are handled through <a href=https://www.namecheap.com/>Namecheap</a>. Hosting is managed by <a href=https://pages.github.com/>Github Pages</a>, where the site&rsquo;s content is stored in <a href=https://github.com/justinmklam/personal-blog>this repository</a> and deployed automatically via <a href=https://github.com/features/actions>Github Actions</a>.</p><p>This site uses <a href=https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/>Google Analytics</a> to help understand visitor traffic and usage patterns.
