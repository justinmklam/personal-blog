In 2015, the inception of my personal blog was created on &lt;a href="https://wordpress.com/">Wordpress&lt;/a> and hosted on &lt;a href="https://www.bluehost.ca/">Bluehost&lt;/a>, and was intended to be a portfolio of my personal projects to showcase when applying to jobs. I spent a lot of time hunting for a suitable theme, and stuck with one for about a year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2016, I wanted to start writing blog posts instead of just having a portfolio, and since I wanted more flexibility in how I was displaying content, I ventured into static site generators and settled on &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo&lt;/a> and used &lt;a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap&lt;/a> to create a custom theme. Later on, as I matured in my career, I realized that having a portfolio was no longer as relevant, so I combined the two types of content into a single blog-like website.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Google Cloud Pubsub for Batch Pipelines in Apache Beam</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2022/11/apache-beam-pubsub/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Nov 2022 12:31:53 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2022/11/apache-beam-pubsub/</guid><description>&lt;p>Google Cloud&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/overview">Pub/Sub&lt;/a> is a useful service that provides an asynchronous and scalable messaging platform that decouples services producing messages from those that receive and process those messages.

It was neat to monitor it this way, but it was fairly impractical to do for each feeding since it required setting up a camera, downloading the images, and doing some manual image cropping before running it through my analysis script. The analysis was also only done after the fact, and what I really wanted was something that could tell me when the starter was ready to be used (or fed), or, if I missed the window of opportunity, how long ago it peaked.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Backyard Chicken Coop in the City</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2021/06/chicken-coop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2020 03:41:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2021/06/chicken-coop/</guid><description>&lt;p>Back in 2018, we decided to raise chickens in our urban backyard, all in the name of being able to have fresh eggs every morning. Our city had bylaws on having chickens, which included:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A maximum of 4 hens (no roosters), 4 months or older&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Ducks, turkeys, or other livestock are not allowed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Eggs, meat, and manure cannot be used for commercial purposes&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Backyard slaughtering is not allowed&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Since we were fortunate enough to have access to a backyard at the time, we decided to build a coop and start the lifestyle of having easy access to fresh eggs. Was it cost effective? Heck no, but it sure was a fun journey!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>3D Printed Engagement Ring</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2019/diy-wedding-ring/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Dec 2019 11:50:22 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2019/diy-wedding-ring/</guid><description>&lt;p class="text-center" style="font-style:oblique">

People have survived for centuries off this staple consisting only of flour, water, salt, and yeast. Try consuming all these ingredients separately, and you&amp;rsquo;ll be in for a digestive surprise. However, mix them together and let time do its thing, and the result is the release of profound flavour, texture, and nutrients that were previously locked away.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite it being relatively easy to turn dough into something that looks and feels like bread, the challenge is in squeezing every possible ounce of flavour and texture (using only those four ingredients) to achieve the embodiment of a true loaf of bread. The secret to artisinal bread is &lt;strong>all in the fermentation.&lt;/strong> A baker&amp;rsquo;s skill is in their ability to manage and control the fermentation process, which is usually achieved through countless months and/or years of trial and error.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Prototype to Cloud: A Python Recipe Converter</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/04/python-flask-heroku-tutorial/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Apr 2018 20:33:46 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/04/python-flask-heroku-tutorial/</guid><description>&lt;p>In case the title wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear, this blog post is about developing a web application using the Python programming language using Jupyter Lab, Flask, and the Heroku platform.

&lt;p>The problem with online baking recipes is that the majority of them use volumetric units.

Maybe Patrick&amp;rsquo;s organic flour is a finer texture. Maybe both Pats &lt;strong>should measure by mass instead of volume&lt;/strong> to avoid all this confusion in the first place.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Synchronous vs Asynchronous Ping Sweep in C# Windows Form</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/02/ping-sweeper/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Feb 2018 17:02:25 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2018/02/ping-sweeper/</guid><description>&lt;p>As a mechatronics engineer (in training), sometimes I like to pretend that I also know how to program.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Like any tech-enthusiast, I have toyed with the idea of owning a 3D printer for quite some time. For my final year mechatronics design project, my partner and I designed an extravagent contraption to measure the yolk done-ness of a soft-boiled egg, which we called &lt;a href="http://justinmklam.com/projects/mecha/perfeggct/">The PerfEGGct&lt;/a>. We borrowed my roommate&amp;rsquo;s 3D printer to create the enclosure, and it turned out to be an indispensable tool during our prototyping process. At the time, reliable 3D printers were upwards of $500 which was just out of my threshold for nice-to-have gadgets.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ESP8266 Sous Vide Controller</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/05/sous-vide-controller/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Feb 2017 12:28:27 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2017/05/sous-vide-controller/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="project-summary">Project Summary&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>Virtual reality pushes the envelope of bleeding edge technology, allowing us to explore and experience worlds beyond our mortal imaginations. It gives us immersion in another dimension, providing an unprecedented medium for communication and story telling. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then virtual reality must be worth millions. Except there’s one thing keeping it grounded to reality: cables.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the first virtual reality headset that was hacked together in 2011, immersive head-mounted displays have progressed far and quickly. Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PSVR are some of the main contenders of virtual reality hardware, and between them lie stark differences in performance and usability. However, cables are the common denominator in these high performance virtual reality headsets. They are tethered to a host computer to provide the computationally intensive processing power required for high-fidelity content. Although mobile solutions are available such as Microsoft’s HoloLens, Samsung VR, Google Daydream, and even Google Cardboard, wired headsets will continue to be the vanguard of high performance virtual reality.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Wooden Phone Stand</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/phone-stand/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2016 21:35:28 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/phone-stand/</guid><description>&lt;p>Phone stands are something that seem a little unnecessary, but once you have one then you&amp;rsquo;ll wonder how your desk lived without one. I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer in having a dedicated place for everything as a solution to keep things tidy, so making a phone stand for my desk at work just made sense.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started off on Google to look for existing designs I could imitate, but most fell short of not fitting my aesthetic needs. I wanted a balance between simplicity and form, without requiring too much effort to make. I eventually came across one design by &lt;a href="https://www.artfire.com/ext/shop/product_view/woodenlife/12640827/creative_wood_phone_stand_handmade/handmade/woodworking/other">Woodenlife on Artfire&lt;/a> and deemed it the winner for my copy-cat woodworking. I sketched out the side profile in SolidWorks, pasted it on to the wood block, and proceeded to cut it out on my bandsaw.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making Do With a Bargain Bin Bandsaw</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/bandsaw/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Oct 2016 20:58:10 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/bandsaw/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s generally known that cheap tools are usually not worth the trouble, but the deal on this bandsaw was simply too hard to pass up.

&lt;p>My paper notebook is excellent for free-form thoughts, sketches, and calculations, but I would want to keep a separate notebook to keep track of these sequential events.

&lt;p>I grew up watching Star Wars, and like any other eight-year old boy, I wanted to become a Jedi Knight. Maneuvering starfighters through the Hoth asteroid field whilst in aerial combat, jousting battle droids wielding nothing but a lightsaber, and having my hand sliced off to make space for my own mechno-arm were the epitomes of my childhood fantasy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Reality came quite bluntly, yet these dreams continued to flourish. These days, they follow more along the lines of maneuvering through complex codebases, attacking architectural design challenges with a pen and paper, and putting my mechatronics background to good use by working on fun side projects.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MECH 458: Capstone 3D Optical Well Imager</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/06/mech-458-capstone/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Jun 2016 12:57:32 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/06/mech-458-capstone/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>

&lt;p style="text-align: justify;">The final design of the prototype includes a camera module, laser module, and two conical mirrors. The basic functionality of the device is shown in the figure below. A red laser ring is generated by the laser module which is reflected by 90° on to the surface of the well casing. The camera’s vision is then reflected by 150° to capture the projected laser ring.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Workshop + Plywood Bench Stool</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/new-workshop/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jun 2016 15:39:56 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/new-workshop/</guid><description>&lt;p>My family moved into a new house, meaning that we finally have an actual garage instead of a measly carport. But what this really means is that I get a chance to claim space to set up an actual workshop! First project was naturally a workbench, which I put together using 2x4&amp;rsquo;s and a 3/4&amp;quot; MDF board for the work surface (see above). Second project was a bench stool, as shown in the following images below. The builders left some 1/8&amp;quot; plywood in the yard, and I wanted to see how sturdy of a chair I can make with it given the inherent flimsiness of the thin sheet stock. By adding a reinforcing cross-brace at the base of the legs, I was able to significantly increase its sturdiness.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Adjustable Portable Power Supply</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/05/power-supply/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2016 17:29:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2016/05/power-supply/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Objective:&lt;/strong> Build a cheap, portable, variable DC power supply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Motivation:&lt;/strong> It was finally time to get my hands on a variable power supply for my electronics projects. Previous projects mainly involved Arduino, which was able to supply 5V and 3.3V with ease. However, the need for a supply with higher voltage, current, and flexibility eventually arose, resulting in the birth of this ghetto (but functional) power supply.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Limitations:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Only DC voltages available&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Max current is a function of input power and desired voltage (I=P/V)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Current limiting feature is non-existent, so must be careful to not let the genie out of circuits&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

However, what you probably don&amp;rsquo;t know is that I made some mistakes in the process. The photo above shows the result of one of these progress speedbumps, and yes, I did indeed cry the day I had to cut those tubes out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started this project in November 2013 but failed to finish due splitting bamboo. Progress was moving forward: I had the bamboo, carbon fibre, and epoxy ready for frame building, and the poles were in the process of being cut and shaped to size. However, winter was quickly approaching and the weather was becoming less and less ideal for carbon fibre layup. The epoxy I was using had a working temperature above 10°C, but the outside temperature was beginning to drop below that. I was able to keep it in its liquid state by using my mother&amp;rsquo;s hair dryer (don&amp;rsquo;t tell her though since she still doesn&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip;), but the epoxy wasn&amp;rsquo;t the main issue. Apparently bamboo is a living thing and doesn&amp;rsquo;t like drastic changes in temperature. Turns out doing the layup in colder temperatures, then bringing the frame inside to dry in warm, livable temperatures wasn&amp;rsquo;t good for the bamboo. Moisture is the devil here, and causes the wood to expand and contract based on the current environmental conditions.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Making of Project Haikuza: Part 2</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/making-haikuza-ii/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2015 23:49:59 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2015/making-haikuza-ii/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>The format of this series is an outline of my thought process during the development of &lt;a href="https://justinmklam.com/projects/software/haikuza/">@thehaikuza&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

Manufacturers recommend replacing a helmet every 2 to 10 years to maintain optimal head protection. To investigate this recommendation, we quantified the material and impact attenuation properties of helmets to determine if they changed with age.</description></item><item><title>MECH 223: Hovercraft Competition</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2013/mech-223-hovercraft/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2013 12:22:15 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2013/mech-223-hovercraft/</guid><description>Teams were given 3 weeks to research, conceptualize, test, and refine their hovercrafts to compete in a class-wide battle of speed, cargo capacity, and maneuverability.</description></item><item><title>Men in Massage: Research Paper</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2011/12/men-in-massage-therapy/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Dec 2011 17:51:38 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2011/12/men-in-massage-therapy/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Originally written as a research paper for ENG 112 at UBC.

&lt;p>According to Tom Delph-Janiurek, a “mis-performance of voice” may be necessary in order to gain authority in specific interactional spaces by creating a display of control and assertiveness (277). He proposes that the vocal performances in teaching spaces adapt to their social roles of authority by opposing the hegemonic heterosexuality in voices and perform vocal features of “drag” without giving up their gendered identities, contributing to and disrupting the “heterosexing of [teaching] space” (277). In spite of his conclusion regarding voice as “drag”, he fails to thoroughly assess the aspects outside of vocal performances that also relate to the projections of gendered bodies such as embodiment. A performed gender role relies on the physical aspects of body language and gesture in addition to voice in order to create a complete portrayal of a sexualized identity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LEGO Headphones</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2010/07/lego-headphones/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2010 12:37:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2010/07/lego-headphones/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;strong>Background:&lt;/strong> I decided to combine the two things that I love most: music and LEGO. This whole project took me about a month and a half, very on and off. I&amp;rsquo;m quite pleased with how the headphones turned out in the end, as they are sturdy enough to be tossed around in a bag. My favourite part is that I can take it apart any time to make repairs that may be needed on the go. No tools necessary!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A Minty-Fresh Power Pack</title><link>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2009/altoids/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2009 22:52:25 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://justinmklam.com/posts/2009/altoids/</guid><description>Before the ubiquity of powerbanks, there was nothing on the market to provide longer battery life for portable electronics.
